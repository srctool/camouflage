Well‑written bug reports help us fix issues faster. Before filing, please:

- Search existing issues and discussions to avoid duplicates.
- Check whether the bug belongs to a specific submodule (kotlin-lib or dart-lib) or to the docs site.
- Try the latest main branch if possible.

What to include
- Summary: a clear, concise title and short description of the problem.
- Environment: OS, toolchain versions (Kotlin/JDK or Dart/Flutter), package versions, and any relevant hardware.
- Steps to reproduce: numbered, minimal steps. Include sample code/config if needed.
- Expected vs actual behavior: what you thought would happen and what actually happened (with logs/screenshots if helpful).
- Additional context: links to related issues/PRs, workarounds tried, or hypothesis about the root cause.
